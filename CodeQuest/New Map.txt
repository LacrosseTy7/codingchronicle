These are the steps to have it be a different map:

1. Make a map with the template I have in Tiled.
2. Export as image everything but Foreground Objects, Battle Zones, and Collision with a zoom level of 400% and name it Ty's Town.png and put it in images.
3. Export as image again but this time with ONLY Foreground Objects and again a zoom level of 400% and name it foregroundObjects.png and put it in images.
4. Export as and name it Ty's Town Map.png but DON'T put it in images.
5. Open Ty's Town Map.png in Notepad "Just Once" and use Ctrl + F to find Collision.
6. Go up and copy the array for Collision and paste it in the file collisions.js.
7. Then do the same for Battle Zones and put that array in battleZones.js.
